# Patients Hospital visits Analysis
For this analysis, we'll utilize the publicly accessible hospital patient visits dataset found on the internet
## <font color = red>**Introduction**</font>
The dataset under analysis consists of 9216 rows and 11 columns, each representing an individual patient encounter within a medical facility. The dataset encompasses various demographic and clinical attributes associated with each patient visit. Key attributes include the date and time of the visit, unique patient identifiers, demographic details such as gender, age, race, and satisfaction score. Additionally, administrative details such as patient administrative status, wait times, and department referrals are included.

This dataset presents an opportunity for comprehensive analysis to gain insights into patient demographics, clinical trends, administrative processes, and service utilization within the medical facility. By exploring these data points, healthcare professionals and administrators can potentially identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in patient care delivery, resource allocation, and operational efficiency. Furthermore, such analysis could inform decision-making processes aimed at enhancing the quality, accessibility, and effectiveness of healthcare services provided within the facility.

## <font color = red>**Aims**</font>

It may sound far-fetched to suggest that certain months, days, or hours could be more dangerous. Hence, the aim of this report is to analyse UK accidents data to give insights into the following questions: 
 
* <font color = green>Are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?</font> <br>
* <font color = green>For motorbikes, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which 
accidents occur? </font><br>
* <font color = green>For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the 
week, on which they are more likely to be involved?</font> <br>
* <font color = green>What impact, if any, does daylight savings have on road traffic accidents in the week after it 
starts and stops? </font><br>
* <font color = green>What impact, if any, does sunrise and sunset times have on road traffic accidents?</font><br>
* <font color = green>Are there particular types of vehicles (engine capacity, age of vehicle, etc.) that are more 
frequently involved in road traffic accidents? </font><br>
* <font color = green>Are there particular conditions (weather, geographic location, situations) that generate more 
road traffic accidents? </font><br>
* <font color = green>How does driver related variables affect the outcome (e.g., age of the driver, and the purpose 
of the journey)? </font><br>
* <font color = green>Can we make predictions about when and where accidents will occur, and the severity of the 
injuries sustained from the data supplied to improve road safety? How well do our models 
compare to government models? </font><br>
